["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Over decades of intensive utilization, small-scale farmers in Africa have removed large quantities of nutrients from their soils without sufficient inputs to replenish them. Ethiopia, holds a substantial proportion of the Horn’s best croplands. However, the natural characteristics, intensive use and fertilization of many of Ethiopia’s lands have lead to acidification. This, along side of loss of topsoil, creates a challenging environment for the region to increase their yields and food supply. In this paper, we look into the effects of soil acidification on wheat, and barley production between 2010 and 2016. In particular, we explore whether farmers would benefit from the application of lime to increase yields in comparison to gain through traditional nitrogen fertilizers. Soils become acidic when basic elements such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium held by soil colloids are replaced by hydrogen ions. Soils formed under conditions of high annual rainfall are generally more acidic than are soils formed under more arid conditions. Additionally, repetitive and intensive use of ammonium-based (urea, ammonium phosphates) fertilizers and manure can further promote acidification. The impact of N-based fertilizers is case dependent but can increase acidity if the N is lost to leaching. At least one research group suggests that for every 1 kg of urea applied nearly 1.8 kg of calcium carbonate is required to neutralize the treated soil. This induced acidification is likely one contributor to farmland abandonment in Ethiopia’s more marginal croplands. Acidification has a number of direct and indirect effects on plant health and development. Correcting soil acidity through the use of lime is the foundation of a good soil fertility program. Maintaining proper soil pH has a variety of primary and secondary benefits including critically, increasing yields and the stimulation of microbial activity. In some experimental wheat plots, lime application can increase root length density by &gt;100 percent and yields by up to 200 percent. Most varieties of wheat grow best in soils with a pH ranging from 6 to 7, with 6.5 often mentioned as the target level. Optimal ranges for barley and corn range from 5.5 to 7. Table 1: Benefits of increasing pH in acidic soils pH ChangeEffect6.1 -&gt; 6.5Improve soil structure, reduce crusting, and reduce power need for tillage5.6 -&gt; 6.0Increase soil microbial activity; increase rhizome health for nitrogen-fixation and other mycorrhizal assisted crops (legumes and barley); increase plant nutrient availability;5.1 -&gt; 5.5Reduce aluminum, H+, and manganese toxicity;&lt;5.1Few crops can produce if not limed Areas with strongly acidic soils can have significant problems with mineral toxicity, as aluminum (Al) and Manganese (Mn) can stunt healthy plant development (McCauley 2017). In many areas the primary growth-limiting factor in acidic soils is aluminum toxicity (Froese, Carter, and Pumphrey 2015). Acidity also slows the mineralization of organic nitrogen (N) and reduces the availability of phosphorus (P), both of which are critical for plant growth and yields (McCauley 2017). Additionally with acidity, critical elements such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium are replaced with hydrogen ions. Essentially H+ ions take up the ‘parking spots’ generally available to important nutrients (McCauley 2017). Although Ethiopia has recently tried addressing low yields by emphasizing blended fertilizers that include many of these nutrients, little has been done to address the growing problem of soil acidity. Liming materials contain calcium and/or magnesium in forms, which when dissolved, will neutralize soil acidity. Not all materials containing calcium and magnesium are capable of reducing soil acidity, and careful attention should be placed on monitoring the effectiveness of these materials. Calcium hydroxide is a strong base and reacts with \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_20\\) in the soil, yielding bicarbonate (\\(HC0_3^-\\)) and hydroxide (\\(OH^-\\)). These take \\(H^+\\) and Al (acid-forming cations) out of solution, and thereby neutralize soil acidity (McCauley 2017). In this report we evaluate the impact of acidic soils on the productivity of wheat, and barley for Ethiopia’s major growing regions. We use agricultural data and measurements of actual soil pH to estimate it’s impact on wheat, and barley yields, while controlling for a variety of other factors. We use this analysis to complete a cost-benefit analysis comparing the use of chemical fertilizers and lime to address the loss in yields found in acidic and highly acidic soils (pH of &lt; 6.5 and &lt;5.5 respectively). Specifically, we evaluate the quantity and cost of the annual fertilizer applications required to obtain the same productivity gains from a single lime application every 5 years. References "],

The AgSS is collected annually by the Ethiopian government. It is a large-scale survey tasked with measuring agricultural production in Ethiopia at the zonal level.1 Each year the AgSS interviews approximately 45,000 farmers on a range of farm management questions covering some basic demographics of the household as well as a range of questions concerning planting, harvesting and selling at the plot level. Typically, about 20 farm households are randomly sampled from small local village-level areas of approximately 200 households (the sub-kebele level). From this sampling frame, a random selection of about 2,200 sub-kebeles are chosen as a representative sub-sample for zonal level agricultural production. Population weights are then applied to project agricultural production at the zonal level. For this study, we construct longitudinal data over the six crop seasons and are able to maintain 75% of all households over the 2010-2015 period at the sub-kebele level. While this study collected data on the five principal Ethiopian field crops (teff, wheat, maize, barley, sorghum), we focus here on wheat, and barley because of their importance in Ethiopia’s food system. The principal unit of analysis is the sub-kebele and all relevant CSA data is aggregated to this level. The survey data represents an amalgamation of all 20 households as a single representative farmer, we refer to as a “super-farmer.” This was done for a variety of reasons including the fragmented plot farming system common in Ethiopia as well as CSA data collection methodology. More specifically, CSA data collection methodology relies on crop cuts to estimate productivity at the local level. Depending on the actual number of farmers growing the specific crop, CSA collects up to five different individual farmer crop cuts, averages the yields, and projects this figure onto all plot areas for that crop in the sub-kebele. For this study we utilized these crop measures of crop yields, measured in quintals per hectare (qq/ha), the percentage of plots applied with ‘improved seeds’, the percentage of plots that have access to irrigation, the percentage of plots actively receiving extension agent support, the intensity of chemical fertilizer use (kg/ha), and the percentage crops reported as damaged by the farmer. Damages include a number of factors including weather, drought, and pests. 2.2 Edaphic Properties Data on edaphic (soil) properties was collected from The Ethiopian Soil Information System (EthioSIS). EthioSIS is charged with gathering soil samples from all major growing regions to help provide detailed information on soil fertility, and to provide fertilizer recommendations. For this study we access EthioSIS measures of soil pH to be used as our variable of interest, as well as measures of cation exchange capacity, soil organic content, and sand content. Cation exchange capacity is a measure of a soils ability to hold and supply nutrients to plants and is affected by soil pH. A map summarizing soil pH levels across the county can be seen below in Figure 1 Figure 1: Map of Ethiopia’s soil pH balance 2.3 Remotely Sensed Variables We obtain climatic variables from the University of Idaho’s TerraClimate data. TerraClimate provides monthly estimates of surface water balance at 1/24th of a degree (~4km) spatial resolution.2 Measures of water balance are particularly relevant to this study because it provides an estimate of water available to plants by looking at the balance between water gained from precipitation and runoff, and that lost to evaporative demand. The amount of water moving through a system is driven by two forces: (1) the supply of water through rainfall and (2) the demand for water, driven primarily by energy from the sun, which allows for evaporation and movement of water through plants but is also affected by wind, vapor pressure, and soil properties. Here we use a measure called the Palmer Drought Severity Index which is derived as a measure of the balance between available water due precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (Abatzoglou et al. 2014). Elevation data is obtained from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at 90 meter resolution.3 2.3.1 Variable Definitions In our multivariate model we control for a variety of independent variables.

["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Regression Strategy 3.2 GAMS Tutorial 3.3 Present Value of Interventions", " Chapter 3 Methods In order to examine the marginal effect of wheat output per hectare to soil acidity, we need to control for the effects of other variables such as water availability, soil properties, elevation, and management difference amongst others. To do this we will run a fixed effects regression on all sub-kebeles for 2010-2016 with year and agricultural zone fixed effects. This regression allows us to examine how a one unit increase in fertilizer or pH effects wheat yields while controlling for other potential determinants of productivity. 3.1 Regression Strategy To control for the highly non-linear nature of some of these relationships, most variables of interest are applied with cubic regression splines within a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) (Wood 2017). These have a cubic spline basis defined by a modest sized set of knots spread evenly through the co-variate values. They are penalized by the conventional integrated square second derivative cubic spline penalty, and will be denoted with s(,n) where n is the degree. GAMs models are a simple extension of polynomial regression and generalized linear models (GLM). The primary difference between polynomial regression and GAMs is that GAMs uses smoothed functions for at least some of our covariates (X), as represented here by \\(f(x)\\). This simple addition will allow for a non-linear relationship between X and y, without imposing a functional form a priori (for instance a squared polynomial, or log-linear). This has a number of critical benefits, most importantly, the non-linear form in GAMs should match that of the underlying data generating process, this in turn provides more accurate estimates of marginal effects and better accuracy in out-of-sample prediction. GAMs models take a familiar functional form: \\[y = b_0 + X +f(x_1)+...+f(x_p)+ \\epsilon\\] Where \\(y\\) is our target variable, \\(b_0\\) is the intercept, \\(X\\) is a vector of linear covariates, \\(f(x_p)\\) defines some basis of non-linear functions, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. This basis can simply be a polynomial one, for instance: \\[f(x) = \\gamma_0+\\gamma_1x^1+\\gamma_2x^2+...+\\gamma_nx^n+\\epsilon\\] In this paper, we use a cubic spline basis to capture non-linear terms: \\[f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\beta_j(x)\\gamma_j+\\epsilon \\] Where \\(\\beta_j\\) cubic spline basis function. Estimation is carried out by penalized maximum likelihood, where there is a penalty for over-fitting (creating wiggly lines) the data.4 Overall, GAMs provides a simple extension to typical modeling approaches that more meaningfully captures non-linear relationships, and increases model accuracy. 3.2 GAMS Tutorial 3.2.1 Setting up the problem Lets try a simple example. First, let’s create a data frame and fill it with some simulated data with an obvious non-linear trend and compare how well some models fit to that data. The following example is pulled from here.

Clearly, the residuals are not evenly spread across values of \\(x\\), and we need to consider a better model. 3.2.2 Running the Analysis Before we consider a GAM, we need to load the package mgcv – the choice for running GAMs in R. To run a GAM, we use: To extract the fitted values, we can use predict just like normal: But for simple models, we can also utilise the method = argument in geom_smooth, specifying the model formula. You can see the model is better fit to the data, but always check the diagnostics. check.gam is quick and easy to view the residual plots. ## ## Method: REML Optimizer: outer newton ## full convergence after 6 iterations. ## Gradient range [-9.46585e-11,7.029666e-11] ## (score 29.99931 &amp; scale 0.1111844). ## Hessian positive definite, eigenvalue range [2.124096,30.68672]. ## Model rank = 10 / 10 ## ## Basis dimension (k) checking results.

Fertilizer applications therefore need to be thought of as a repeated costs over a five year period, the present value of these costs therefore must be calculated. 3.3.1 Current Cost of Future Lime and Fertilizer Expenditures The present value of a future cost can be calculated using a few pieces of information: 1) the cost paid each year, 2) the discount rate, and whether or not the cost is incurred at the beginning or end of the year. Here we assume that that annual costs of fertilizer remain constant at 15 birr per kilogram. Fertilizers will be applied at a rate equal to the estimated yield benefits of a single lime application. We also assume a discount rate of 15%, which accounts for the typical rate of return of an alternative investment, and we assume the costs are incurred at the beginning of each planting season. The present value (cost) of a series of future expenditures is as follows: \\[\\ PV=\\sum_{t=0}^{T}FV \\frac{1}{(1+i)^t}\\] In this case, PV is the present value of future expenditures, FV is the annual cost of fertilizer, i is the discount rate, and T is the number of years payments are made. As such we can estimate the present value of applications of lime and fertilizer required to obtain the same yield increase (qq/ha) in wheat yields estimated above. References "],
["findings.html", "Chapter 4 Findings 4.1 National Estimates 4.2 Regional Estimates 4.3 Local Estimates", " Chapter 4 Findings 4.1 National Estimates To isolate the marginal effect of pH on yields we can hold all other variables at their mean (fixed effects variables are set to a specific year and zone, here 2010 and zone number 302) while letting the variable of interest vary. For more information on how these estimates were made refer to Methods. Figure 2: Trace of marginal response of wheat yield to changes in pH Looking at Figure 2 above we can see that moving pH from 5.5 to 6.5 corresponds to a significant increase in yields for wheat while holding fertilizer utilization, rainfall, and other variables of interest at their means. The gain obtained from moving soil pH from 5.5 to 6.5 for all crops is presented in Table 3 below. These curves will be used in the next section to calculate the economic net benefit of application of lime (to increase pH) to soils. Table 3: Output per hectare gains from changing pH from 5.5 to 6.5 We can also trace the impact of increasing fertilization rates for wheat and barley in Figure 3 below. Figure 3: Marginal response of wheat yield to changes in fertilizer application holding pH at 5.5 Looking at Figure 3 for wheat, we can see that adding an additional 100 kg per ha of fertilizer corresponds to a substantial increase in yields while holding pH at 5.5, and rainfall, and other variables of interest at their means. This curve can then be used to calculate the economic net benefit of application of fertilizer. As such we can estimate the present value of applications of lime and fertilizer required to obtain the same qq/ha increase in wheat yields estimated above. Table 4: Wheat: Present value of lime and fertilizer applications required for equivalent yield increases From table 4 we can see that, that the present cost of fertilizer use for wheat is 2.15 times that of a single lime application. Meanwhile the cost of a comparable fertilizer application for barley is 1.88 times as high as lime. As such lime can provide substantial savings to both small and large farms across a variety of crops. It should be noted however that there are additional benefits to treating acidic soils with lime instead of compensating with nitrogen. Benefits of liming not easily captured in this study include: Reductions in additional acidification through fertilizer application Supplies Ca and Mg to plants Reduced toxicity to plants of Al and Mn More rapid mineralization of organic N and greater availability of P Stimulation of microbial activity Greater availability of micro-nutrients 4.2 Regional Estimates The impacts of these applications vary significantly by both actual pH level and location. There is a great deal of variability even between regions in terms of policy interventions, but also in terms of the actual pH levels. Therefore the benefits of mitigating “moderately” acidic soils is far more beneficial in Amhara than in Tigray. To examine some of this variability we break down the expected increase in yields (OPH) from raising the pH of each sub-kebele to 6.5 by crop and region below: Table 5: Median impact of increasing pH from actual to 6.5 in qq/ha for moderately acidic soils As we can see there is a great deal of variability between crops, with high gains in output for wheat and barley (Table 5). These differences are largely driven by difference in each plant’s response to pH level. It is also driven by the planting location its respective soil properties, like aluminum concentrations that mitigate or aggravate the impact of a low pH balance. Within a given crop, for instance wheat, variability in yield response can largely be explained by the region’s distance from a median pH of 6.5. As explained earlier, the pH in Amhara, SNNP, and Oromia are at the lower end of “moderately” acidic, therefore gains can be substantial. Meanwhile Tigray’s “moderately” acidic soils are extremely close to a pH of 6.5, therefore raising the pH provides less benefit. Table 6: Median impact of increasing pH from actual to 6.5 in qq/ha for highly acidic soils Looking at Table 6 above for highly acidic soils, we see for both barley and wheat substantial yield gains are obtainable by properly adjusting the pH balance. This uniform yield response across regions can be explained by the overriding influence of a pH significantly below certain levels. Following the approach shown in Table 7 we can calculated the present value of the amount of fertilizer needed to match the yield gains obtained by increasing the pH to 6.5. Again we break this down by acidity class, region and crop. Table 7: Median fertilizer requirements to match lime application for acidic soils Table 7 demonstrates for mildly acidic soils - from a purely economic standpoint - that the application of fertilizer on average is less costly than the application of lime. In the case of barley, lime may prove more expensive in all regions, on average. In the case of wheat, there may be some slight advantage to lime application in SNNP, but not in other regions. Keep in mind however there are a number of other non-financial benefits to soil remediation and proper pH balance. Table 8: Median fertilizer requirements to match lime application for highly acidic soils For highly acidic soils (Table 8), the economic gains of lime applications become clear, especially for wheat in all regions. Across all regions the economic benefit of lime application for wheat in highly acidic soils is 2.14 times that of fertilizer applications. Barley grown in Amhara and Tigray also see a substantial benefit from the application of lime. On average these two regions the economic benefit is 2 times that of fertilizer applications. The benefits of lime application however extend well beyond simple yield gains, and are worth repeating. The benefits of lime application include: increased Ca Mg and P supply, reduced mineral toxicity, stimulation of microbial activity, avoiding induced acidification through fertilizer application, and more efficient uptake of N and availability, amongst others. 4.3 Local Estimates We can also look at the spatial distribution of these gains in productivity from lime application. Below we can see the impact of lime application to increase pH to a minimum of 6.5 for both barley and wheat. As expected the benefits of lime application follow patterns of soil pH but also reflect differences in growing conditions between both barley and wheat A tutorial on making webmaps in R’s BookDown can be found here link "],
["conclusions.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusions", " Chapter 5 Conclusions Ethiopia’s growing regions span an unusually broad set of climatic spaces, spanning a variety of zones from rain-forests, Mediterranean ecosystems, to semi-arid deserts. Given the well documented sensitivity to changes due to climate change, Ethiopia must look for ways to enhance the productivity of all its lands, especially those now considered marginal. This broadening of the climatic space that is productively used for agriculture will enhance household and national resiliency. Although not well understood until recently, Ethiopia has a significant problem with acidic soils. Soils with low pH can significantly suppress agricultural yields and may prompt the abandonment of otherwise productive lands. Ethiopia’s soils likely became acidic due to long periods of weathering, erosion, intensive use, as well as the additional acidity induced by the application of fertilizers. Additionally, some areas also have significant problems with alkaline soils, which undermine plant productivity in ways very similar to acidity. In this study we approach estimating the economic and agricultural viability of soil remediation, through the application of lime, through data-driven methods. We utilize observations of agricultural yields for wheat and barley from the AgSS survey for the 2010-2016 growing seasons. We control for a variety of confounding effects such as weather, other soil properties, management practices, and government interventions. We find that moderately and highly acidic soils significantly undermine yields for both wheat and barley. Moreover, we find evidence on a region by region basis for the economic viability of soil remediation through the application of lime, especially in highly acidic areas. Taken as a whole we find substantial real-world evidence that soil remediation can increase yields and economic outcomes for farmers across its acidic regions. "],
